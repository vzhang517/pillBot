*PillBot* uses the OpenFDA API in order to relay drug information to the user.

## Background

People everywhere use perscription drugs, but not everyone reads the packets of information attached. With PillBot there's a one stop place to find all of your drug warnings, information, and interactions.


## About PillBot

PillBot was built using React as the frontend framework, we used Node.js as the server with Express as the router, and MongoDB as the database.



## Starting the Application

To start, run
```
npm start
